# Introduction

Welcome to Session 4! So far, you’ve learned how to work with data in R,
create functions, and explore basic data manipulations. In this session,
you’ll step into the world of tidy data and the tidyverse. We’ll also
show you how to leverage ggplot2 for exploratory data analysis.

We will use a gene expression matrix where:

-   Column 1 = Gene name (e.g., ENSEMBL IDs).

-   Columns 2-8 = Expression counts for 7 samples.

-   Samples 1 to 3 belong to one condition.

-   Samples 4 to 7 belong to a second condition.

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

-   Understand what tidy data is and how it differs from non-tidy data.

-   Read data using tidyverse functions and compare tibbles vs. data
    frames.

-   Grasp the basics of ggplot2 syntax: data, aes(), and layers.

-   Reshape data for plotting using pivot_longer() and understand “wide”
    vs. “long” formats.

-   Filter lowly expressed genes with tidyverse.

-   Normalize counts using counts per million (CPM) from edgeR, then
    visualize with ggplot2.

Let’s jump in!

# 1. Tidy Data

## 1.1 What is Tidy Data?

In R, tidy data is an approach to structuring your data so that:

-   Each variable is in its own column.

-   Each observation is a row.

-   Each type of observational unit is a separate table

Think of your dataset as a well-organized closet, with each shelf
dedicated to a single item type—no mismatched socks stuffed in random
places! This structure makes it easier to perform manipulations,
analyses, and visualizations. 1.2 Advantages of Tidy Data

-   Consistency: Because each column is a clear variable, you always
    know where to find what you need.

-   Compatibility: Many R packages (especially within the tidyverse)
    expect data in tidy format to work smoothly.

-   Readability: It’s more intuitive to understand the data at a glance.

## 1.3 Example Tidy vs. Non-Tidy

### Non-Tidy Example

```{r}



non_tidy <- tribble(
  ~Gene,      ~Sample1_expression, ~Sample2_expression, ~Condition1, ~Condition2,
  "ENSG0001", 100,                 150,                 "blue",      "red",
  "ENSG0002", 200,                 300,                 "blue",      "red"
)

kable(non_tidy, caption = "Non-Tidy Data Example")
```

Each column combines what should be separate variables
(Sample1_expression lumps “Sample” and “Expression” in the column name).
Conditions might be in separate columns, which could be better
represented as a single “Condition” variable.

### Tidy Example

```{r}

tidy <- tribble(
  ~Gene,      ~Sample, ~Condition, ~Expression,
  "ENSG0001", 1,       "blue",     100,
  "ENSG0001", 2,       "blue",     150,
  "ENSG0002", 1,       "red",      200,
  "ENSG0002", 2,       "red",      300
)

kable(tidy, caption = "Tidy Data Example")

```

Now you have one column for Gene, one for Sample, one for Condition, and
one for the Expression value. This layout is more flexible for functions
like ggplot(), dplyr verbs, etc.

# 2. Reading Data with the Tidyverse

The tidyverse is a collection of packages designed with shared ideas
about how data should be structured and manipulated (e.g., dplyr, tidyr,
readr, ggplot2).

## Tibble vs. Data Frame

When you read data with read_csv() (from readr, a core tidyverse
package), you get a tibble instead of a base R data frame. A tibble is
basically a data frame with:

-   A more refined print method (so it doesn’t flood your console with
    too many columns/rows).

-   Better handling of column names and data types.

### Advantages of Tibbles:

-   Better defaults: They don’t convert strings to factors by default.

-   Partial row printing: Tibbles show you a preview without overloading
    the console.

-   Implicit type-stable: You’re less likely to run into surprises
    during data manipulation.

-   You can still work with tibbles using all the regular data frame
    functions, so it’s generally a smooth transition.

# 3. ggplot2: Grammar of Graphics

ggplot2 is like constructing a plot by layering components:

-   data = The dataset you want to visualize.

-   aes() = Aesthetics that map columns to visual features (e.g., x, y,
    color, fill).

-   geom\_\* = Geoms or geometry layers that define how the data is
    drawn (points, lines, bars, densities, etc.).

### Basic Syntax:

ggplot(data = <DATA>, aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +\
<GEOM_FUNCTION>()

<DATA> is typically a data frame or tibble.

<MAPPINGS> are aes(x = something, y = something_else, color = group) or
similar.

Each + adds a new “layer” to the plot.

I always recommend bookmarking the following website with step by step
tutorials for making many plots:

[**https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials**](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials){.uri}

## 3.1 Example: Creating a Box Plot

Let’s create a quick example tibble to demonstrate. Suppose we have a
small dataset of Gene, Sample, and Expression:

```{r}
# Create a toy tibble
example_data <- tibble(
  Gene = c("ENSG0001", "ENSG0002", "ENSG0003", "ENSG0004"),
  Sample1 = c(100, 150, 300, 500),
  Sample2 = c(80, 130, 350, 400)
)

# For ggplot, we often want the data in LONG format:
long_data <- example_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Sample"), 
    names_to = "Sample",
    values_to = "Expression"
  )

# Now let's plot a boxplot:
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Sample, y = Expression)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis='y', stackdir='center', dotsize=1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,600,50))+
  labs(title = "Example Box Plot", x = NULL, y = "Expression Value") +
  coord_flip()

```

Here, we used:

pivot_longer() to go from wide to long.

aes(x = Sample, y = Expression) to map columns to axes.

geom_boxplot() to draw the boxplot layer.

# 4. Formatting a Tibble for ggplot: Pivoting

We often have expression data in wide format, something like:

```{r}
wide_example <- tribble(
  ~Gene,       ~Sample1, ~Sample2, ~Sample3, ~Sample4,
  "ENSG0001",      100,      120,      130,       80,
  "ENSG0002",      400,      200,      300,      500,
  "ENSG0003",      250,      260,      270,      280
)

kable(wide_example, caption = "Wide Format (Non-Tidy) Gene Expression Matrix")
```

But ggplot2 loves long format, which might look like:

```{r}
# Pivot to long format
wide_example %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Sample"),
    names_prefix = "Sample",
    names_to = "Sample",
    values_to = "Expression"
  )

kable(tidy_example, caption = "Tidy Format Gene Expression Matrix")
```

To get there, we use pivot_longer() from tidyr.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
long_data <- wide_example %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Gene,           # or specify e.g. 2:8 if you know your gene col is 1
    names_to = "Sample",
    names_to = "Sample",
    values_to = "Expression"
  )

kable(tidy_example, caption = "Tidy Format Gene Expression Matrix")

```

If you still need help visualizing it, we can look at the following
example from this
[website](https://tavareshugo.github.io/r-intro-tidyverse-gapminder/09-reshaping/index.html):

## 4.1 Practice Exercises

**Plot a Boxplot:**

From the toy data, create a simple boxplot of Expression by Sample.

```{r}

# Toy data: 10 genes, 3 samples
example_data <- tibble(
  Gene = paste0("ENSG0000", 1:10),
  Sample1 = sample(50:500, 10),
  Sample2 = sample(50:500, 10),
  Sample3 = sample(50:500, 10)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Gene, 
    names_to = "Sample",
    values_to = "Expression")


ggplot(data = example_data, aes(x = Sample, y = Expression)) +
  geom_boxplot() 

```

# Putting it all together!

Let’s read a count matrix named count_df with columns:

ENSEMBL = Gene IDs (like ENSG000000...) in the first column.

Sample1 through Sample7 = Expression counts in columns 2 through 8.

```{r}

# Read a TSV file into a tibble
count_df <- read_tsv("~/GitHub/WorkshopR/IntroductoryLevel/data/exp_matrix.tsv")
# Check the first rows
head(count_df)
```

## 5.1 Pivoting & Exploratory Plots

```{r}
count_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Sample"),
               names_prefix = "Sample", 
               names_to = "Sample", 
               values_to = "Expression") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Expression + 1, color = Sample)) +
    geom_density() +
    scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log10', labels = scales::comma) +
    labs(title = "Gene expression density plot")

```

In this code:

-   pivot_longer(!ENSEMBL) means pivot all columns except the ENSEMBL
    column

-   We then call ggplot(), mapping x = value (the expression) and color
    = name (the sample).

## 5.2 Annotating Conditions

Next, we can add a “condition” column based on which sample belongs to
which group. For instance, samples 1 to 3 are “blue,” and samples 4 to 7
are “red.”

For this part we will learn a new type of dplyr function called
**mutate()**

### How does mutate work

As any mutation, you're making a permanent change in the information!

We will start with a simple mutation and then we'll progress to more
complex rearrangements.

```{r}
temp <- count_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Sample"),
               names_prefix = "Sample", 
               names_to = "Sample", 
               values_to = "Expression") %>%
  mutate(Sample = as.numeric(Sample)) # Convert to numeric

temp

```

You can verify the data type under the Sample column!

Now let's add the information for samples 1 to 3 are “blue,” and samples
4 to 7 are “red.”

```{r}
temp <- count_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Sample"),
               names_prefix = "Sample", 
               names_to = "Sample", 
               values_to = "Expression") %>%
  mutate(Sample = as.numeric(Sample)) %>% # Convert to numeric
  mutate(Condition = ifelse(Sample <= 3, "red", "blue"))

temp

```

Looks good so far, we created a new column named Condition. This new
mutated column has the information for "Red" or "Blue" conditions. Now
let's do the plot!

```{r}

temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Expression + 1, color = Condition)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log10', labels = scales::comma)+
  labs(title = "Gene expression density plot by condition")
```

## 5.3 Filtering Lowly Expressed Genes and using groups

Before diving further, you might want to remove genes with very low
expression across all samples. For example, keep only genes that have at
least 5 counts in half the samples.

```{r}
# Number of sample columns
num_samples <- ceiling(7 / 2)
threshold   <- 5

# We can achieve this by first doing a well-known pivot
count_df_long <- count_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols   = starts_with("Sample"),
    names_to  = "Sample",
    values_to = "Counts"
  )

# Then we group the data by gene and we 
filtered_genes <- count_df_long %>%
  # one group per gene
  group_by(ENSEMBL) %>%  
  summarise(n_above = sum(Counts >= threshold), .groups = "drop") %>%
  # keep genes that pass
  filter(n_above >= num_samples) %>%
  #vector of gene IDs
  pull(ENSEMBL)                       

# keep only those genes
count_df_filtered <- count_df %>%                               
  filter(ENSEMBL %in% filtered_genes)



```

In the tidyverse, the concept of groups is central to how functions like
summarize(), mutate(), and filter() can be applied in a segmented way.
Here’s the big picture:

-   group_by(): Creates “subsets” of your data based on one or more
    columns.

-   Subsequent Operations: Functions like summarize(), mutate(), or even
    filter() will then operate within each group independently.

-   Ungrouping: If you want to return to the dataset without these group
    boundaries, you can use ungroup() or the option .groups = "drop"
    within summarise

```{r}


# Pretend this is pivoted data: each row is (Gene, Sample, Condition, Expression)
toy_long <- tibble(
  Gene       = rep(paste0("ENSG000", 1:5), each = 2),
  Sample     = rep(c("Sample1", "Sample2"), times = 5),
  Condition  = rep(c("blue", "red"), times = 5),
  Expression = c(100, 200, 150, 250, 120, 300, 85, 210, 400, 550)
)

# 1) Group by Condition
toy_long_grouped <- toy_long %>%
  group_by(Condition)

# 2) Summarize within each Condition
toy_summary <- toy_long_grouped %>%
  summarize(
    mean_expr = mean(Expression),
    sd_expr   = sd(Expression),
    count_genes = n()
  )

toy_summary
```

### Why Grouping Matters

-   Clarity: You can explicitly define how data is segmented (e.g., by
    condition, timepoint, replicate).

-   Modularity: Summaries and statistics are produced for each subgroup.

-   Scalability: Works seamlessly with large datasets; no need to
    manually split data frames or write loops.

By combining group_by() with summarize(), mutate(), and even filter(),
you gain flexible, readable ways to handle complex biological datasets —
whether you’re computing means of expression by condition, trimming out
lowly expressed genes in specific groups, or normalizing each group
differently.

## 5.4 Normalizing Counts with CPM

Before further analysis, we often normalize gene counts to account for
different library sizes. A common approach is to convert counts to
counts per million (CPM), then transform to log space for better
visualization. We can do this with the edgeR package:

```{r}
# CPM takes a matrix object with only numeric values, so we need to remove the gene column:

exp_mat <- count_df_filtered %>%
  select(-ENSEMBL) %>%
  as.matrix()

# So we don't lose the gene IDs:
rownames(exp_mat) <- count_df_filtered$ENSEMBL

expr_log2cpm <- cpm(exp_mat, log = TRUE, prior.count = 1) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("ENSEMBL")

# Now let's pivot that data for plotting:
expr_log2cpm  %>%   # If row names are gene IDs
  pivot_longer(!ENSEMBL, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "Expression") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Expression, color = Sample))+
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Log2-CPM Normalized Gene Expression Density")

```

## 5.5 Violin Plots
